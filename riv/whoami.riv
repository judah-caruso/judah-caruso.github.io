Hi, my name is Judah Caruso and I like to make things. Below is a small set of questions you may or may not care about:


DO YOU HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA?

I try to **not** be on social media as much as possible, but I do have [https://twitter.com/judah_dev Twitter], [https://github.com/judah-caruso GitHub], [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ39Lfwi3X8HNfx1n_wo_yA YouTube], and [https://www.twitch.tv/judahcaruso Twitch].


WHAT LANGUAGES DO YOU USE?

I experiment with a lot of different programming languages, but these have always stuck around:

- [https://go.dev/ Go]
- C
- C#


WHAT'S YOUR SETUP?

It's gone through a lot of iterations over the years, but I've settled on:

- M2 Macbook Air or Zephyrus G15
- Sublime Text, barebones with vintage mode

WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE NOT WRITING CODE?

I haven't done it in a while, but I used to produce music. That was my main focus for many years, and was a decently unsuccessful career while I scavenged for programming and writing gigs. These days I write short stories, repair typewriters (*I know...*), work on board game ideas, and study languages.


WHAT LANGUAGES DO YOU SPEAK?

- Korean ~B2
- French ~A2
- Mandarin ~A1
- Ukrainian, Farsi, Japanese (dabbled or can read/write) 


WHO/WHAT INSPIRES YOU TO MAKE?

Seeing others make things inspires the most. I get a lot of joy out of seeing what they've done and trying to replicate it without knowing the process; essentially learning through doing.
